10016,1,question,"You said that a computer wouldn't be conscious, but now we're developing qubits and quantum computers. do you think now that sort of quantum magic that you need to get consciousness could therefore be contained in a quantum computer?"
10016,2,question,"So my question is about a particular feature of your writing. Your books are phenomenally clear, and one of the unique features that you add to your books is you usually start them with a small story. So in Shadows of the Mind you start with a story of a little girl and her father in a cave, And in one of the other books you start with Amtep the sculptor, kind of waking up. The question is: why do you start with these stories and what are you trying to create or accomplish?"
10016,4,question,"I wanted to pick up on Yang's idea of beauty. Do you find that we've lost a sense that we should do things so that they could be useful and we're driven more by the compulsion to make them useful? I'm afraid my hearing is not good, So the question was about beauty, and are we driven to create music and beauty?"
10016,5,question,"The beautiful is the aim of the endeavor, whether it's scientific or philosophical or moral, and more driven by compulsion towards utility."
10016,6,question,"I'd like to ask about the subject of your cyclical universes theory. You pose some of the problems in your book, some of the challenges that you may receive because of that theory. One of them is the remaining mass in the universe, that is, electrons that won't go away. You posit that it may be okay because they can't make clocks, and that perhaps that would be sufficient, But you didn't like the idea of having to accept that. Do you have any new thoughts on that area now that since the book has been written?"
10020,1,question,"I was wondering. you mentioned about biopolymers and how they could be used as a building material or as a substitue for building materials. to what extent is this true? Like what materials could be substitued using these biopolymers? Ho, much of a building could be made using these."
10020,2,question,"And if it's not a silly question. there are no silly questions. If we convert carbon dioxide to methane and if we burn methane, we finish up with CO2 again. yes, How is that helping?"
10020,3,question,"You've been talking about heterogeneous catalysis. yes, obviously that's your field. Are people doing homogeneous catalysis in similar areas, trying to achieve the same things?"
10020,5,question,"The other really silly question is: are you going to be able to take CO2, carbonic acid- out of seawater?"
10020,6,question,"Still time for a few more questions. There's a young man in the. Would it be possible to, using the right catalyst, combine lots of carbon dioxide molecules together to get the right polymers we need directly, just by connecting them one by one?"
10020,7,question,"My wife says that to enable me to clean up the planet and do my bit for the planet, so I must buy lots of platinum jewelry. Am I being done for a mug?"
10020,8,question,"You mentioned imaging and the importance Just that. obviously, being able to see exactly what the surface looks like is one thing, but actually being able to watch a reaction take place, I guess, would be the holy grail of that. How far along that process are we? Can you tell me a bit more about that?"
10020,9,question,"I was just wondering if you're actually trying to go from plastic back to oil. is there any kind of business? you know, if we can go one way, can we go the other way? So take all the leftover plastic and the garbage that is everywhere and turn it back into oil."
10020,10,question,"I just wondered: does the catalyst get exhausted and is there enough of the raw stuff to make the catalyst? I mean, you're talking about really rare stuff like platinum and so on. That's my concept. There's not much of it about. Is there enough for the work that we need to get done with them?"
10025,1,question,"You covered this briefly in your talk. Ben asks: 'Data visualization clearly puts a lot of power in the hands of the designer and statistician. How do we ensure that you communicate the real, or at least balanced, truth'?"
10025,2,question,"It does sound like a lot of work, like science, communication in general, and a lot of work bringing in people from varied backgrounds. Exactly like multiple perspectives. Yeah, exactly, I don't realize the pressure behind data visualization, though It really is powerNo, there is a lot of pressure."
10025,3,question,"Raj asks: 'How can we use data visualization to challenge fake news', And someone else also asked: 'Conversely, how do you think data visualization has contributed to fake news?"
10025,4,question,Anand asks: 'What's your view on the problems that colorblind people may have with the use of certain colors or also most people being distracted by moire patterns from cross hatching'?
10025,5,question,"That links quite nicely to, because a couple of people have also been asking if you know of any work that's been done around data visualization for visually impaired people. Is there anything based on sound or music or maybe other senses that might be involved?"
10025,6,question,"S McNeil has asked: 'Do you take into account the target audience when planning how to visualize the data, For example, a different way for scientists or engineers compared to an audience of the general public'?"
10025,7,question,And one question said: 'It looks like you really like using nature as your inspiration. Is there any particular reason you think something as complex as nature is a good tool for simplifying data visualization'.
10025,10,question,Is there a specific piece of software you prefer to use for your visualization?
10025,11,question,"What has been the key lessons you took away in your journey of doing this kind of work, and have you considered linking it to more sophisticated algorithms like machine learning and the data they offer?"
10025,12,question,Who are your key influences in this field?
10067,1,question,"Space is made up of quanta of space that are connected. If they're connected in a very orderly way, then dimensions would emerge from that as an emergent property of orderly connected quanta of space, Whereas if they're connected in a very disorderly way, then concepts of localism would be confused, because you've got the idea that going different routes between two points to form a metric space could be completely destroyed If you had a connection between two quanta that was shortcutting an otherwise very long route between quantam."
10067,2,question,Thank you Hi. thank you very much for a very nice talk. My question is: how could your hypothesis be proved wrong?
10067,3,question,"Can you talk a bit about how the ideas you've discussed relate to some of the thinking that's come out of the Wolfram Physics Project: The idea that you could model the universe as basically the output of an iterative program that's running on it and, like you're talking, the idea of computational equivalence, that some things can't be worked out by us because they're as hard as the universe unfolding."
10067,4,question,"You establish your theory and due course and the universe turns out to be non-computable. Does that mean that, left to itself, physics is either going to have to stop or we're going to be able to sort of change our trajectory by our own efforts? If you can't predict, you make something happen yourself. It doesn't mean either the end of physics or that we sort of take the universe over."
10067,5,question,"Hello. Coming back to the weather systems you were talking about In the AI community, they're working on emulator systems, right? These are neural networks which are trained on the output of these dynamical runs. The idea is they run quicker and cheaper than running the dynamical equations from start to finish. In particular, I'm aware of a claim from Deep Mind that their neural network emulator of weather systems outperforms- and I think you mentioned the name of the organization, but there's a standard program that they run, in particular to predict the path of hurricanes. They claim that they outperform this system. What is your take generally on emulators and how does it sit with your ideas of non-computability?"
10069,1,question,"Well, thank you very much, David. That was an absolutely fascinating talk. There's been loads of great conversations in the chat, lots of people with the surname Sumpter in the chat. They seem to be enjoying it quite a lot, as do lots of people. So thank you all for your questions too. Please do keep them coming in, but I've got a few that I'll kick off with. If we go back to the gambling equation, I think you mentioned something about. you know, Germans are very pessimistic and Brazilians are very optimistic in their betting. So Andrew Witts asks: is it possible to account for human factors like bias empirically in the gambling equation? So obviously you had the alpha and the beta kind of fitting the curves, but is there any more you can sort of tweak that equation to account for those kinds of like?"
10069,3,question,"Actually, Yelm asked the question, which is: do you know how much money they started with?"
10069,4,question,"And just finally, on that, clive rudd asks the question. he mentioned something i've heard of but absolutely could not explain, which is, i said: would the psychology modeling of the gambling equation look similar to those in the black-scholes-merton formula, which i know is something to do with finance and stocks? and that's it."
10069,5,question,"And you can see I called it 'Skulls' because I was thinking. So we'll go on to some other questions now. So Keith asks: how could Google patent an equation that was already in the public domain? I don't think it was just the equation that they patented, right?"
10069,6,question,"I absolutely am not a patent lawyer and absolutely not an expert on US law, but isn't it the case that that sort of these patents came to, you know, people in the 90s and early 2000s where they came in front of judges and other people that just simply had no concept of what this technology was or, and so people were able to patent these incredibly general things. like you know, displaying an image on the internet and just patenting that- Yeah, it has become kind of a problem in development."
10069,7,question,"Yeah, someone says it's the embodiment of the equation, which is patentable, rather than the equation itself- probably someone who knows more about law than I do. Yeah, but the implementation on that particular thing, And Ayan was just. it's also asking: are your colleagues now gambling addicts or is the fact that they just do everything mathematically means that they never, ever, make a fun bet ever? They just let the computer and the algorithm do everything and they never actually make their own wagers at all."
10069,8,question,"So presumably you yourself have been approached. This is what Rocco was just asking the questions. Actually, you yourself must have had, you know, a phone call from you know. maybe someone at Everton have seen what Liverpool are doing and they're like 'Oh, we need to get our own maths analyst. Who's this guy who wrote a book? Let's get him'. You must have had phone calls and emails."
10069,9,question,"Excellent. So, moving on to a slightly different topic, Unfortunately- apologies everyone- I do try and pronounce people with sort of non-English names the best I can. You know, we have a lot of viewers in India. Hi to everyone from India, But this person's name I'm finding very hard to pronounce asks: 'Can you use maths to win at poker', Which I think is obviously yes, but I wonder if you'd like to sort of expand on that. Well, there was actually a psychologist recently, is it Maria Konnikova? who's sort of got a book out about poker, but she was sort of coming up more from a psychology perspective. But there's been people before her, is that right?"
10069,10,question,"And an optimal person. I'm just trying to think that over in my head and that doesn't matter about the opponent. So if you're playing incredibly irrational humans or very, very considerate, I mean, because you started playing poker."
10069,12,question,"Oh, fantastic, I'll go. I've done that, that one that I was going to, Somebody else asked, or any of the equations to do with finance, because someone's all mentioned Jim Simmons, who's like a billionaire hedge fund manager, who."
10069,13,question,"Wow. and so that sort of analogous isn't it? to the football betting- You know, football matches, without actually knowing who the first choice left back is for Uruguay? Stefano brings up a question- I think I can't remember if this formula was one of the ten or not, but he asks: 'What about Bayes' formula and what's that useful for', Because I think we've heard it's come up quite a lot recently in British media. I don't know about Sweden, because suddenly we're all finding out about specificity and sensitivity of tests, and it's been a lovely moment of public education of mathematics where suddenly people are like 'What? But the test is 95% accurate' Anyway, I'll let you explain it better than I could."
10069,14,question,"We've had a few recommendations. actually Clive was saying Hannah Fry actually did a nice Bayes' theorem demonstration in the Christmas lectures last year, which if you haven't seen, it's on the Royal Institution YouTube channel, so do check them out, they're very good. But actually someone else was asking- I don't know if they're asking you or just asking the room- really if there are any other popular mathematics books. Obviously, Hannah Fry's book 'Hello World' was really good and I wonder if there are any other authors or any other mathematical books that you've enjoyed."
10069,15,question,"Which, but that's the one. and look at my bookshelf. I mean I was very inspired by James Gleick's book 'Chaos' and then there was a book by Roger Highfield called 'Complexity', which I thought was just amazing. And then Philip Ball's book I just looked at, called 'Critical Mass', is another book that I would really recommend, which isn't quite popular science, And so now I'm moving more into the past, but I think there's some great things to see there. There is Thomas Schelling's book called 'Micromotives and Macro Behavior', which is not directly a maths book, but it's all about how individual interactions create patterns which are more than the sum of the parts, which has been a lot about what my research has been about. So I thought of that for the 'Critical Mass' book with Philip Ball. So those are the three books I mentioned there and the Thomas Schelling book. They're the ones that made me personally become a popular science writer and got me inspired about how you communicate. I also love- actually now I've forgotten the one that I love best, and it's Nassim Taleb's book. Although that guy is crazy, his first two books are just brilliant, like the 'Fooled by Randomness' book- just brilliant. I don't agree very much with what he says most of the time. but that book is just, it's so funny. Just finally, it was just a sort of random question which I couldn't quite see if that was on your list of equations or not. but Moreno asks about the confidence equation. Is it one of your ones or not?"
10069,16,question,"And yeah, so actually throughout the coronavirus pandemic we've had learning how to read exponential graphs properly, learning about specificity and sensitivity in Bayes' formula, learning about epidemiological spreads and exponential curves, and now also about how algorithms might go out of control if you don't, if you try to apply general algorithms to an individual. So I think it's been. it's been. yeah, maybe that's the point why everyone's been so into our maths talks, because suddenly maths is now more relevant than it's been in everyone's lives."
10079,1,question,"For a fabulous and spectacular tour. we have a little time for questions, both from the audience here, where we have microphones, and from the audience online. I have one of my own, just to begin with. There's an old saying about artificial intelligence. when people are asked whether AI is going to replace doctors, they say, 'Well, it'll only replace the doctors that don't learn to work with AI'. I just wondered: how do historians feel about you? Are you going to replace them in some sense? Do you have access to a truth? Tell us about your relationship with historians. Do you augment, Do you challenge? Do they welcome you?"
10079,2,question,"Terry, was part of the Christmas lectures, which some of you will have perhaps seen, or some of you would have been to them, but certainly you would have seen them online. Those of you in the UK can watch them on the iPlayer. they'll be on our YouTube channel in a little while. One of the things that Sue Black, the lecturer, was at pains to point out is that we can't necessarily prove things are right using DNA. we can certainly prove things are wrong and rule things out. Is that a role that you've been able to play?"
10079,3,question,"Yes, very much enjoyed your presentation. Could I take you back to the screen that you've got there? You were looking to see whether Professor Jeffries had a similar taste in sweaters, to Judge, and because they weren't related then that was ruled out. But is it possible, or has anyone done any work that looks at the degree to which similarities between cousins, second cousins, third cousins, do reflect their heritage? So just because somebody has the same surname, does it mean they have the same taste in music, the same taste in sweaters? or is it the case that, because DNA is only shared to a very small extent across generations, that traits are not shared to the same extent across generations?"
10079,4,question,"Hello, thank you very much for this election. I was wondering what advice would you give to someone who is going to research their ancestry and their family and probably use DNA for that purpose. I have two main questions Aside from that question is what tools in terms of databases and genetic tests you would advise, and the ethics side, which is very complicated."
10079,5,question,"Okay, and another question from Nigel is: as one enters the family tree of genealogy websites such as Ancestry, do they give you hints as to possible family members? How do the hints algorithms work? Are they reliable?"
10079,6,question,"Yeah, and another question before we go back to the audience is: if there was another famous person that you would like to dig another for, who would it be?"
10079,8,question,I just wanted to know what inspired you to start studying genetics and what do you love most about what you do- with everything.
10079,9,question,"Yeah, can i ask us like, do you have a question? yeah, good, let's bring in microphone in here and just one quick question as i might come down. um, there's a old. i'm like the ri fan is 17.99. all about the responsibility of scientists to engage the public with what they do. i mean, that's literally why we were formed. um, tell us, from a scientific, professional point of view, how your public work has been received amongst your colleagues."
10079,10,question,Um how much of an effect do you think gene editing will have on these forensics in future?
10092,1,question,"From primary school homework right up to judgments at the Old Bailey. we're required to show our working in our reasoning and decisions that we make. With a lot of examples you showed it seemed to be a weakness in the IT as it was making apparently certain decisions without a lot of justification, like 'the sheep were pink, therefore they were flowers' If that was revealed it would obviously help. Is there a lot of research into creating algorithms that can produce an answer of reasoning?"
10092,2,question,So the thing where the algorithm decides if they go to jail or not. what if the person entered in fate?
10092,3,question,"Great, I'm actually going to follow that personally. So the question that I had was actually on fake news, and fake news is something that we are all aware of and find abhorrent and it's very negative. But actually, given there's so much of it, is there a positive in fake news, forcing us to be more questioning of things that we actually thought were true before?"
10092,4,question,"Hi, my name is Jose. I'm from Ecuador, So I think that, talking about autonomous driving and judging when we have big data sets, we will encounter a time in which there's an autonomous car going through the road and there's going to be a collision, which is inevitable, meaning that you have a young child or you're going to hit an older person. Who's going to be given that weight on that day to say, 'Saying that old person has only a life expectancy of 10 years and you have a child that has a life expectancy of 50 years? Who gives that type of power on wait, on the data that you're using, and how is that being controlled? Because, at the end, neither of those two choices are the correct one."
10092,5,question,"Yes, a lot of what he talked about was kind of how a lot of algorithms right now are a bit rubbish. At what point in the next couple of years do you see a lot of them not being rubbish? And you know, certainly in crime and kind of autonomous cars and crime prediction and medicine- do you see a time in the next- is it 10 years, 25 years, 50 years, a hundred years- At what point do you think we'll hand a lot of this stuff over to them?"
10092,7,question,"Hi, and what professions will go? because AI will be able to do it better."
10092,8,question,Just a question of what was it that made you want to get into this kind of work? was it when you were younger you kind of thought problem solving?
10092,9,question,"Hello. so I'm slightly blown away. 'cause why am I seizing fluid dynamics? I didn't do a PhD, so I have to stand up here and I have a PhD- amazing stats. but I grew up in a farming community. So when you put those pictures up of the bed of the hills, I went 'Look, 'cause that's a sheep hill'. I grew up in a sheep farming community. that's quite clearly a sheep, and so I grew up in the Pennines. I'm pretty sure I know where you took that. So my question is this: in all the math that I've done, how did you include that inherent bias? that's clearly a sheep hill and I know it's a sheep hill."
10117,1,question,"Let's kick off with an interesting question from Garth. He asked how important is wildlife habitat destruction in engendering development of pandemics, especially for bats. Now I was thinking actually this might work both ways: If we destroy all of the wildlife habitats for all of these bats, then they'll die and then, you know, that might actually stop new pandemics emerging. But I guess it's much more complicated than that."
10117,2,question,"So those virus families would be the coronaviruses, flu viruses, as well any other families."
10117,3,question,"Swine flu and bird flu. well, i was gonna say respectfully, but i got that wrong way around, but you know what i mean. so there's another question here from steve roderick, who and he asks: how important is it to get the incidence of covid-19 to very low levels so that it finds it hard to mutate? and just to add to that, i had heard that as we sort of vaccinate more and more, that maybe the viruses that are left might mutate more. so i'm not quite sure what's going to happen. but as we start to eradicate it, is there more chance of it mutating or is there less chance?"
10117,4,question,"So that kind of follows on to a question by Damandeep who says: 'What should governments do to look to prevent a flu-like situation in which yearly vaccinations will be required', And I guess the answer is: get as many needles into as many arms as possible, as quickly as possible. is that right?"
10117,5,question,"Actually, PD12 made a point here which is just comparing the different types of vaccine. I think at the moment, if I'm correct, we now have five different vaccines licensed in the UK: the Oxford AstraZenica vaccine, Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson. Now I believe they actually work in different ways. I don't know if you want to explain the difference between how they work."
10117,6,question,"Andre, if I may, I believe you haven't had the vaccine yet, have you? Would you have a preference, or would you just say any vaccine is liable to be infinitely better than no vaccine, so it doesn't matter."
10117,7,question,Which one did you get and are you happy with it so far?
10117,8,question,"Absolutely Just an interesting question here which is come from death roddles, which is a great name. They ask: 'When the body's infected with things like flu and coronavirus, what the body tries to respond by coughing and sneezing and generally by spreading the viruses as much as possible? Why do our bodies respond in this way, And is this sort of part of why viruses have been so successful, in that the very thing our body does to try and rid ourselves of the virus is also spreading the virus out to everyone in our office or train carriage or wherever we are'?"
10117,10,question,"What about the outside of the mask or the inside of the mask, though? That's the thing you have to watch."
10117,11,question,"Just thinking about the current coronavirus, I think a lot of the measures that were put in place for things like swine flu and bird flu were things like temperature checks at airports, which, of course, if you're pre-symptomatic it's not going to show. You can still have a totally normal temperature and come into a country or go somewhere, and then you're spreading the virus. So having a test where you can get immediate accurate results is a game changer."
10117,12,question,"And while we're on the subject of asymptomatic patients, Nikki asked a question going back to the idea of the adaptive immune system. Is it that people who are asymptomatic- they're completely asymptomatic. they have the infection, they deal with it, they don't notice any symptoms and then you know they have an antibody test and find out that they were infected at some point? Is it because those people have a much more efficient adaptive immune system, They're able to deal with the infection more easily? I mean, is this why younger people are less affected than older people? or how does that work in some people who show absolutely no symptoms compared to people who are very seriously ill?"
10117,13,question,"Does that mean? obviously, if I was in a very confined space with someone with the virus for a long period of time, would that mean I'll have a much bigger viral load than if I just kind of walk past. you know, caught a whiff of some virus in a shop. Is that too simplistic, or is that correct?"
10117,14,question,"So it's almost like you want that Goldilocks amount of virus. that's just enough to trigger the immune response, but not actually enough to give you any symptoms."
10117,15,question,"So that's what David Jung actually mentioned in the chat. He said it appears pandemics will become more frequent in the future. What do you think should be the strategy to anticipate and get ahead of these events before they happen? I think you've mentioned the idea of producing a generalized coronavirus vaccine and maybe even a generalized flu vaccine, but are there other things that governments could be doing or putting in place to try and get ahead of these things? I mean, be more like New Zealand and Taiwan maybe."
10117,16,question,"And while we're on that, that kind of global perspective, Steve asks an interesting question where he sort of makes the point: are we in the West still at risk, even when we've been vaccinated, because of the vaccine inequality around the world? If developing countries are struggling to vaccinate and richer countries kind of hoard all the vaccine and there's swathes of Africa and other developing areas that are left unvaccinated, well, this obviously gives the virus more chance to mutate and more chance to then become effective against vaccinated populations. So how can we make sure that the vaccines are sort of distributed accurately around the world, If you to speak a bit more about that kind of global development perspective?"
10117,17,question,"So just another question here, which was- Ms Jennifer asked the question which was going back to the different vaccines and their different mechanisms of action. Basically saying, would it be beneficial, therefore, if I had, given that most of them are on a two-dose regimen, would it be better for me to have the Pfizer vaccine for one shot and then the Oxford vaccine as the other shot? so therefore I've kind of got a more broad protection, or is that not quite? Obviously, of course, the vaccine studies are only studying one vaccine taken at one time, and these kind of complex interactions between two different vaccines would be completely untested, of course. but in theory, would it be beneficial? Arabs, you looking a little bit confused."
10117,18,question,"Absolutely fascinating. I have to say, Our time is almost up, that's completely flown by. So thank you so much. I've just got one question, actually, which was from AJ, who asked: 'What was your favorite part about writing the book'. Also, I'm just kind of interested in how the process of being co-authors work. Did you sort of take a chapter each and check each other's work, or how was the process for you and did you enjoy it?"
10123,1,question,"So I'm going to start off with a question about the hard problem of consciousness. Aziz asks: 'Can we definitively say that there is a higher consciousness associated with the hard problem, or could it be science simply hasn't been able to uncover a hidden mechanism?"
10123,2,question,"Garth has asked: 'Do you have examples of where brain injury has resulted in beneficial effects, either greater creativity or intellect, etc."
10123,3,question,Wylie has asked about patient W and they've asked: how do we know that he wasn't sorry? how do we know that he was having an image of the dogs and chicken? How do you know it wasn't a memory that he knows dogs should have four legs and chickens should have two legs?
10123,4,question,"Oh, it's good. yeah, we're learning more. That kind of links to my next question about the brain stem, because I know you said a lot of it comes from there. Nafera asks: could it be that lesions in the brain stem could affect functioning of other parts of the brain that are actually in charge of consciousness?"
10123,5,question,Lara has asked: 'What is the difference between the data processing at the brain and the consciousness?
10123,6,question,"That'll be good. um, i've got a couple of questions about the future um, as it were. so dr carnan um asks: can quantum field theory help to explain- or in explaining, sorry- the subjective of consciousness?"
10123,7,question,"And we have time for one last question, and from atiab, who asks: assuming that technology exists in the near future, do you think an artificial brain can recreate consciousness by recreating properly and rewiring artificial neurons in the brainstem cortex or hc, which? i should know what that is after this talk, but i do not."
10261,1,question,"Thank you for the wonderful discourse and, if I understood and extrapolated correctly, can we ascribe our different responses to stress to changes in the genetics of our mothers, grandmothers, great grandmothers, due to stresses in their lives that caused their genes to change."
10261,2,question,"This is one for Judy. It's about the section of your talk when you were talking about the different stress responses to different levels or qualities of childcare. To the rest of your talk I understood that most often the level of cortisol was more or less associated with the level of stress: more stress, more cortisol. In that particular chart, if I read it correctly, the worst form of childcare resulted in the least cortisol in the morning, but more- that's the same- amount of cortisol- in the afternoon, and that was deemed to be a bad thing. So in that instance more stress equaled less cortisol. So that seemed to be different to what was being reported in the other side. so I was confused as to why that might be the case."
10261,3,question,"A question for Judy and you said that children have very good insight into their stress levels that they're experiencing, whereas adults don't, In a research environment. obviously part of the problem might be demand characteristics or social desirability bias.

10261,5,question,"Hi, thank you very much. This is for the first gentleman. In one of his slides he had mentioned that cortisol inhibits the formation of new nerve cells in the brain. I'm just wondering number one, how, And also when you're under a lot of stress, are there any studies for behavior? if you've been under a lot of stress for a long time, Does that mean with the last nerve cells? I'm not a science person, but I mean, does that lead to some disease?"
10261,7,question,"Hi, thanks very much. My question has been really interesting, everything that you've said. I was wondering particularly about depression. Depression has become quite prominent specifically today, and we don't hear much about it in history. So I was wondering: is that because of increased awareness or is that because in today's society people are more depressed than they were? Also, what are your thoughts about the future? I mean, obviously you can't predict the future, but what do you see? is depression on the rise?"
10261,9,question,"I had two actually. One was the relationship between stress, fear and anxiety, And the second one was on the torture point. I was really interested to see about the ineffectiveness as a way of revoking memory, but in a way, having never thought about it before, I would have thought the torture was about overcoming resistance and breaking will, rather than somehow working memory."
10261,10,question,"Hi, in the presentation it was mentioned briefly that children with lower levels of cortisol initially starting school had higher risks of having illnesses later, as in like during school, and I assume this is referencing to non-stress-related illnesses.

10261,11,question,"Good evening. in the first talk, cortisol was told that cortisol kills cells in the brain but that it also reinforces aversive memories. How does it exactly reinforce aversive memories""?"
10261,12,question,"Yes, we've heard that a lack of stress, or reduction in stress is good for depression, it's good for bringing up kids and it's good for getting confessions out of victims. Can the three people on the panel please give us their best guess at how to reduce stress?"

10261,14,question,"You mentioned earlier that the second generation of Holocaust survivors have higher stress levels and you're not sure why is that right? That's what the lady said. I think, Yes, that's right. Well, my father's a Holocaust survivor and I'm the second generation And I think it's because of the my father has had like all his life he's talked to me about he's lost all his family and he gets very, very stressed easily. And I go to a second generation Holocaust group and all of us. it's fascinating because we've all had the same experiences. Like if my father was sitting next to me now, he would tell me: for goodness sake, keep your head down, don't speak, keep quiet. Because one of the things, for example, is that he learned to survive. he had to keep his head down, Like don't keep your head up above the parapet because someone will kill you, you know. And he's always been like that and that's how I was brought up, which has made it much harder for me to. That's just one example. So of course, I've also grown up more stressed, I know."
